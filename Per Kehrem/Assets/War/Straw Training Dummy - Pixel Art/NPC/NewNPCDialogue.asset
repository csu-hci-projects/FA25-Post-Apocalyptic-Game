  - Hey watch where you're going!
  - Heh, no worries. I can teach you about this world!
  - A while ago, in a place called the Old City, a power plant suffered a meltdown.
  - 'The entire world was destroyed. '
  - Surrounded by mountains, the nation of Selvain was the most protected.
  - Not untouched though, so it's good you've come here.
  - Shakhan.
  - To get here I'm sure you're familiar with the WASD/arrow controls.
  - Hit tab to open the menu, it will show you your stats, inventory, map, and settings.
  - Left click on certain objects to carry them. You can see them in your inventory.
  - For now, only wearable items like armor go in the equipped category.
  - 'To talk with characters, or to learn more about items, '
  - see the red star appear above your head and press 'E'.
  - 'Don''t worry that the star disappears even when you return to a conversation. '
  - Just hit 'E' like normal to continue dialogue.
  - Although make sure your not to far away from the subject either.
  - For combat, well, there's no better way than to learn by example!
